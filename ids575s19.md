# Statistical Models and Methods for Business Analytics
### <center> IDS 575 (Spring 2019) </center> 

Document version: Jan 27 2019

## Overview

The goal of this class is to cover the foundations of modern statistics and machine learning complementing the data mining focus of IDS 572. In other words, you will get up to speed with the requisite background as well as the key theoretical underpinnings of modern analytics. We will do so through the lens of statistical machine learning.
